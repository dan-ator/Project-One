Flash Cards Program

User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to play flash cards to improve my knowledge of a subject.
2. As a user, I want to customize flashcards to pass a test/for a specific situation.
3. As a user, I want to play with flash cards to have fun.
4. As a user, I want to customize the flash cards to learn specifically what I need to learn.
5. As a user, I want to play flashcards to compete against my friends.
6. As a user I want to be able to add pictures to improve my performance.

Approach: I first set up the basic properties of the page using HTML and CSS.  Next, I set up the data set array to be used for the flash cards.
With that in place, I worked incrementally on the functionality of turning over the cards, progressing back and forth through the deck, and finally
on the correct and incorrect functions.

I attempted to have a user input area so a user could make his/her own flash cards but was not able to successfully implement this.
