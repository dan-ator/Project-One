# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is very clearly scoped, and your user
stories are good. My one suggestion with them is to make them a bit 'smaller'
and focused on one feature at a time. e.g. "As a user, I want to be able to flip
a card so I can see what's on the other side".

Nice readme too!


## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Great job! In addition to a nice simple design, your app
is highly functional (I'd definitely use it!). Adding cards would be nice,
but I think you got pretty close to getting that working..

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Your code is overall very readable, and most of all,
you've solved the problem simply and clearly. I particularly liked your choices
for naming variables and functions. Great job!

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. Not a lot to add here... you solved the problem well and
simply.
